My Personal Assistant - JARVIS

This is a simple jarvis assistant build using python. It took me some time to make it work on linux, but somehow managed to do it.
If you are a linux or mac or windows user, this is going to work. But you may need to install some python packages.

BTW I use Arch Linux.
